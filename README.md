PayPal REST API Issues
====================================
Issue tracking for REST APIs bugs, features, and documentation requests.  This repo is a replacement for all the various server issues that were previously tracked using PayPal SDK repositories.

## Categorization

Once triaged, all issues will have a minimum of two labels, specifying whether it's a bug, feature, or documentation issue, and another specifying the affected API.  It is possible that an issue spans more than one API, in which case it will have more than one API label.


## Filing issues

As with any issue tracker, we advise you to search this repository for an existing issue before filing a new one as there may be an existing issue with the same. If you're certain that you are adding a new issue, please fill out the issue template with as many details as possible.
